# MoveVote
RECOMMEND MOVIE TO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

Orbital 2016

Given so many choices today, many of us tends to have a hard time making decisions and it is almost impossible to make without additional information or guidance. Furthermore, many pieces of research have demonstrated that usersâ€™ marginal utility decreases when confronted with too many choices. Our aims for this summer project is to help users make better choices about which movies to watch.

We proposed to build a collective intelligence web application (MoveVote) that can smartly predict and recommend movies that you and your friends will like. MoveVote is definitely very useful if you are planning to watch movies with a group of friends or with your loved ones.

Our team will employ a hybrid approach (both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering) to assist our users in their decision-making process. As content-based filtering and collaborative filtering have their own advantages and disadvantages, the hybrid approach will provide a promising extension. We will be leveraging on The Movie Database (TMDB) for pulling movie content information.

MoveVote will be built and hosted on Google App Engine, a platform for building scalable web applications and mobile backends. We have chosen picked this platform as it provides many built-in services and APIs such as DataStore, Google Identity Toolkit and Task Scheduling. In addition, Google App Engine allows us to remove the time spent on maintaining our own server and spend more time to innovate on our project solution. In terms of security aspect, Google App Engine provides an automated security scanner to scan and detect common web application vulnerabilities.

## Features
* Personalized Movie Recommendation - Sign up for MoveVote and by rating some movies, we can help you get more movies that you and/or your group of friends will like.
* Latest Movie Showing Time - Not sure when and where your latest movie will be showing today and tomorrow? MoveVote can help you get all these information for you.
